Epicodus: Week9, Day5

<em>Maureen Dugan, Liz Tom, and Angela Yen</em>

Building a Twitter clone to practice using Action Mailer and testing with Letter Opener.
Project started by Maureen and Liz; second half, which focused on DRY code, refining testing, and relationships, completed by Angela and Maureen.

--

For today's project, let's make a clone of Twitter.

* Start off with user signups. When somebody signs up, send them a welcome email.
* Let users post tweets and delete their tweets.
* Then, if another user's handle is mentioned in the tweet using " @username ", send that user a notification email.
* Now, let users follow each other. Of course, notify somebody by email if when they are followed. Add pages showing who a user follows, and who follows them.
